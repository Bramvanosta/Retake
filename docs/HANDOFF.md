# Handoff — read this first in a new session

Last updated: 2026-10-11, end of lot L2.1. Working branch: `claude/new-session-pq6jtq`.

## What this is
Demo Studio: a generic, product-agnostic tool (licence-ready in a V2) that turns a written scenario into a
professional product video — drive a real web app headless with an in-page cursor, capture it cleanly, then edit it
automatically with themeable components, and let Claude operate everything through an MCP server.

## Read in this order
1. `docs/SPEC.md` — the brief, especially §0 (product principles), §11 (components), §12 (Studio app), §14 (phases).
2. `docs/ROADMAP.md` — lots, sizes, status, working agreement. **Work one lot at a time; the user decides how many.**
3. The lot's requirements: `node scripts/requirements.mjs --lot <id>` (source of truth: `docs/requirements.json`).
4. Contracts: `docs/DESIGN.md` (phase 1 packages), `docs/DESIGN-phase2.md` (components, editor, review, comments),
   `packages/core/src/types.ts`, `packages/components/src/types.ts`, `packages/editor/src/plan-types.ts`.
5. References: `docs/reference/look.md` (measured target look), `docs/reference/choreography.md` (field-tested
   cursor/click/typing rules), `docs/design-brief.md` + the mock-up canvas (Studio screens 1–7 and video frames in two
   themes): https://claude.ai/artifact/CEa9o9do5hr9AcLBajLRye (private to the owner).
6. `README.md` — usage, scenario language reference, CLI.

## State
- **Phase 1 done** (commit `0df4a29`): core (scenario language, strict schemas, positioned errors), runner-web
  (headless capture, in-page cursor on real input, click strategies, widgets, screencast → CFR mp4, timeline.json),
  hooks (http/sql/shell/js + rollback journal + allow-list), CLI (`studio …`), fixture product
  `fixtures/wholesale` ("Northfield", fictional, real Radix + Base UI), project `projects/northfield-fixture`,
  starter templates `default`, `editorial`, `motion`. 275 tests pass (6 Postgres tests need `DEMO_STUDIO_TEST_PG`).
- **L1.1 done** (phase-1 polish + `studio doctor`): invented fixture names (test-guarded), ripple ring visible on
  same-colour buttons, field-notes ripple/motion curves, scene `cursor` key (auto rest point next to the first
  target, no visible jump), every widget click in `data.clicks`, standalone hook journals in
  `<project>/.demo-studio/journals/`, pacing `nudge_*`, `after_navigation_ms`, `popup_fallback_ms`, `scroll_offset`,
  64 KB DOM snippets, project `locale` → browser locale, missing hook files are errors, `studio doctor`,
  `docs/MACOS-CHECKLIST.md` (the steps of L1.5). 301 tests pass (6 Postgres tests skipped).
- **L2.1 done** (phase-2 contracts in core): `ComponentKind`, `COMPONENT_KINDS`, `ComponentRef`, `ComponentId`,
  `COMPONENT_ID_RE` and `FrameSpec` live in `packages/core` (`@demo-studio/components` re-exports the first three);
  template `brand` + `components` (id or `{id, params}`, `null` = none) with `resolveThemeComponents()` (legacy field
  mapping, `source: theme|legacy|default`) and a validation warning when an entry contradicts a legacy field; scenario
  `intro`/`outro`/`interstitial` take `component` + `params`, new `card:` entries (no capture time, `card-<n>` default
  id), `frame` = FrameStyle or layout id on project/scenario/scene, step `overlay` (≤ 30 s); the runner records card
  scenes, `event.overlay` with the anchor measured at the END of the step (camera too) and `timeline.video` (title,
  intro, outro, effective frame, template, music; `timelineVideo()` in core). Starter templates declare brand +
  components; the quote fixture has a card and an overlay (run `20261011-172942-quote`: overlay bbox on the €720.00
  total). JSON Schemas regenerated. 345 tests pass (6 Postgres tests skipped).
- **Requirements:** 529 tracked; 200 done; the open ones are assigned to lots L1.2 … L6.
- **Groundwork for phase 2:** contracts in core (L2.1) + components types + EditPlan types. `packages/{editor,review,
  mcp}` are otherwise empty; `studio render|review|export|record|mcp|ui` print "available in phase N".

## Next lot
**L2.2 — components package foundation** (M): manifest schema + validation, registry (workspace → built-in, resolve
with params defaults — use core's `resolveThemeComponents` for theme defaults and `COMPONENT_ID_RE` for ids),
scaffolding, `themeTokens` (template `brand` is now available), kit helpers — unless the user picks otherwise (L1.2
robustness, L1.3 capture smoothness, L1.5 = the user runs `docs/MACOS-CHECKLIST.md` on a Mac). See ROADMAP.

## Decisions (do not re-litigate)
- The tool stays generic: no client/brand/person names anywhere in the repo or its history (history was squashed for
  this). Customer material lives in the user's own workspace (`DEMO_STUDIO_ROOT` or a `studio.yaml`).
- Everything visual in the edit is a **component** (plugin) with a manifest; themes (templates) give tokens and pick
  components; workspace components can be created by Claude through a skill; a cloud marketplace comes in V2.
- **Frame comments** are stored as files in the workspace and exposed to Claude through MCP; anchored to the render
  frame and to the scenario (scene/step/segment/component) via the edit plan's provenance.
- **Studio app**: web UI first (`studio ui`), Tauri macOS shell later around the same UI; scenario shown as blocks /
  cards / badges, two-way with YAML; timeline with live Remotion Player preview and one-click component switching;
  Run and Record screens as in the canvas.
- Backlog lives **only in the repo** (no Linear). Small lots; each lot is committed and pushed; consumption reported.
- The user allowed force-pushes on this working branch (used to squash WIP checkpoints into one commit per phase/lot).
- App UI language: English. Conversation with the user: French.

## Conventions
- TypeScript ESM/NodeNext, relative imports end in `.js`; `pnpm build` (= `tsc -b`), `pnpm test` (= `vitest run`;
  `vitest.config.ts` aliases `@demo-studio/*` to `src/`). No new dependencies without a strong reason.
- Commit messages end with the session attribution lines given by the harness. Never commit `runs/`, `renders/`,
  `review/`, frames or videos (git-ignored).
- At the end of a lot: update `docs/requirements.json` (status/evidence/gap), run `node scripts/requirements.mjs`,
  update this file and ROADMAP's status table, commit, push, report.

## Environment notes (Linux cloud container)
- Chromium 141 via playwright-core 1.56.1 (`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers`); new headless
  (`channel: 'chromium'`). Remotion renders with `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium_headless_shell-1194/chrome-linux/headless_shell`.
- ffmpeg 6.1 on PATH. Postgres 16 installed (`pg_ctlcluster 16 main start`, run as the postgres user).
- No GPU: pages with heavy effects (backdrop blur) are captured at 6–10 fps during cursor motion (L1.3). No display and
  no macOS: login, `--headed`, Keychain and notifications are verified by the user on a Mac (L1.5).
- Fixture: `node fixtures/wholesale/server.mjs` (console :4401, shop :4402), then
  `node packages/cli/dist/bin.js run northfield-fixture catalogue` (add `--dry` for a rehearsal).
